        <h2 className="par-recipes">What foods are healthy?</h2>
        
        <p>For optimal health, science supports following a plant-based diet like the Mediterranean-DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, and MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet. Plant-based diets have been shown to have various health benefits and are linked with a lower risk of heart disease, cancer, and other chronic illnesses.

<p>With so many food options available with plant-based diets, there are many healthy recipes you can make.</p>

<p>While most foods in plant-based diets offer important health benefits, 
    certain ones stand out. These “superfoods” pack the biggest nutritional 
    punch. People should try to eat some of these healthy foods every day or as often as possible. They include the following:</p>

<p>Berries. High in fiber, berries are naturally sweet, and their rich colors mean they are high in antioxidants and disease-fighting nutrients.
Fatty fish. Fatty fish can be a good source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids, which help prevent heart disease. Those with the highest omega-3 content are salmon, mackerel, trout, anchovies, and sardines.
Leafy greens. Dark, leafy greens are a good source of vitamin A, vitamin C, and calcium, as well as several phytochemicals (chemicals made by plants) that fight inflammation and protect cells from damage.
Nuts. Hazelnuts, walnuts, almonds, and pecans are good plant protein sources. They also contain monounsaturated fats, which may be a factor in reducing the risk of heart disease.
Olive oil. Olive oil is a good source of vitamin E, polyphenols, and monounsaturated fatty acids, all of which help reduce the risk of heart disease.
Whole grains. A good source of soluble and insoluble fiber, whole grains also contain several B vitamins and minerals. They have been shown to lower cholesterol and protect against heart disease and diabetes.
Yogurt. A good source of calcium and protein, yogurt contains live cultures called probiotics. These "good bacteria" can protect the body from other harmful bacteria.
Cruciferous vegetables. These include broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, collard greens, kale, kohlrabi, mustard greens, radishes, and turnips. They are an excellent source of fiber, vitamins, and phytochemicals, which may help prevent some types of cancer. 
Legumes. This broad category includes kidney, black, red, and garbanzo beans, soybeans, and peas. Legumes are an excellent source of fiber, folate, and protein; studies show they can help reduce the risk of heart disease.
What does a typical healthy meal from a plant-based diet look like? A great visual guide is the Harvard Healthy Eating Plate. It shows the proportions of the healthy foods you should eat. At most meals, try to fill half of your plate with vegetables and fruit, a quarter with whole grains, and the final quarter with lean protein.</p>
