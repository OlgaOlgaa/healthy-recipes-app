        <p>Proper nutrition becomes even more important after men and women reach age 50. 
            It helps keep energy levels up and protects against many age-related illnesses and diseases like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.</p>
 
 <p>But is there a best diet for men and women over 50?</p>
  
 <p>There is no single way to eat for good health. While everyone needs carbohydrates, fat, 
    and protein, there is no “magic” ratio that you should strive for as long as you avoid
     extremes. In fact, recent studies have found that the quality of the food is more
      important than whether it’s low-fat, low-carb, or somewhere in between.</p>
  
 <p>While details may vary from diet to diet, all healthy eating plans have four basic principles in common:</p>
  
 
 <p>Lots of plants. Plant foods—vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and seeds—offer a 
    wealth of vitamins and minerals. They also contain fiber and healthful compounds 
    called phytochemicals, natural substances in plants that provide a range of health benefits,
     including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and even anti-cancer activity.
 Adequate protein. Abundant research shows it’s essential to eat enough protein. 
 There are many protein sources, but plant protein (beans, lentils, soy foods, nuts, seeds) 
 and fish offer the most health benefits.
 Minimally processed foods. A diet high in ultra-processed foods causes weight gain and unhealthy 
 shifts in blood sugar and cholesterol. Food processing often strips away nutrients while adding
  extra fats, sugars, sodium, additives, and preservatives.
 Limited saturated fats, added sugars, and sodium. The U.S. government’s Dietary Guidelines for 
 Americans recommend limiting saturated fat intake to less than 10% of daily calories. 
 The same goes for added sugars (sugars added during processing). As for sodium, keep it below 
 2,300 milligrams (mg) per day—the average American consumes far too much, more than 3,400 mg per day.</p>
