       <p>Should you take daily vitamins?</p>

<p>“Dietary supplement” is an umbrella term. It includes individual vitamins, 
    such as A, B, C, D, E, and K, and minerals like calcium, multivitamins 
    (a product that contains 10 or more vitamins, minerals, or both), 
    and specialized senior or gender-specific formulas that contain 
    various combinations of vitamins, minerals, and other compounds.</p>

<p>Should you take a daily supplement?</p>

<p>Even though supplements are popular, there is limited evidence they offer 
    significant health benefits or help protect against disease. For the
     average healthy adult, eating a balanced diet with plenty of fruits 
     and vegetables provides all the essential vitamins and minerals.</p>

<p>However, there are situations when people may need a dietary supplement, 
    such as those diagnosed with a vitamin deficiency that’s been confirmed
     by a blood test, those who have trouble getting certain vitamins from foods,
     or those who suffer from conditions that require extra vitamins or minerals.</p>

<p>For example, strict vegans may not get enough vitamin B-12, which is found primarily 
    in animal products. Low levels of vitamins B-12 and B-6 can stem from digestive disorders,
     such as Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, and ulcerative colitis, conditions that make it 
     difficult to absorb nutrients. Adults diagnosed with osteoporosis may require extra vitamin
      D and calcium beyond what they get from their regular diet. Moreover, people who are 
      lactose intolerant, and avoid dairy products, may not get enough vitamin D and calcium.</p>

<p>Doctors have differing opinions about dietary supplements. Some believe they are not necessary.
     Others take a “might-help-won’t-hurt” approach to fill in nutritional gaps in one’s diet. 
     And studies have shown that taking dietary supplements as prescribed usually doesn’t cause serious issues.</p>

<p>If you want to explore taking a supplement, first check with your doctor. He or she can advise 
    whether they are needed and help choose the appropriate over-the-counter brand. The FDA monitors
     disease-related claims on dietary supplement labels but does not ensure whether a product contains the ingredients listed on its label.</p>
