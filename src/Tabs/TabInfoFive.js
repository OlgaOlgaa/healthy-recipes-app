        <p> Healthy eating doesnâ€™t have to be hard. With a bit of preparation and planning, 
            it can be easy to create healthy meals for the entire week. Meal prep has many 
            benefits: It can help save time and money and help with portion control for 
            weight management. It also reduces the stress of daily decisions about what to eat. </p>
 
 <p>Here are some steps on how to meal prep.</p>
  
 <p>Gather meal ideas. Collect healthy recipes and save them in a binder or copy recipe
     links onto an online spreadsheet. Consider specific meals or foods for different 
     days of the week, like Meatless Mondays, Whole Grain Wednesdays, and Stir-Fry Fridays.</p>
  
<p> Begin small: Create enough dinners for two to three days of the week, and then go from there.</p>
  
 <p>Pick a day. Choose a specific day of the week to do the following:</p>
 
<p>Plan the menu (whether weekly or several days) and write out your grocery list.</p>

 <p>Some of these days may overlap but breaking up these tasks can keep meal planning manageable.</p>
  
 <p>Cook in order. On meal prep day, focus first on foods that take the longest to cook.
     If you prefer not to pre-cook proteins, consider marinating poultry, fish, or even
      tofu on your prep day so you can pop them into the oven or stir-fry them later in the week.</p>
  
 <p>Multi-task. While foods are baking or bubbling on the stovetop, chop vegetables a
    nd fresh fruit, or wash and dry salad greens for later in the week.</p>
  
 <p>Make extras. When possible, make extra portions of recipes for another 
    day or two of meals, or freeze them for the following week.</p>
  
 <p>Storage. Label all prepped items with a date so that you can track when to
     use them. Rotate stored items so that the oldest foods/meals are kept up front. 
     Store highly perishable items like greens, herbs, and chopped fruits front and
      center at eye level, so you remember to use them. Freeze cooked meals in airtight containers.</p>
  
 <p>Stock up. Work at stocking your kitchen with the following staples.
     This ensures you always have the basics on hand for meal prep and when you need to suddenly whip up healthy meals.</p>
 
 <p>For your fridge: fruits, vegetables, dark leafy greens, low-fat cheese, fresh salsa, plain yogurt, eggs, chicken, low-fat milk, pesto, light mayonnaise, hummus, and lemons.</p>
 <p>For your freezer: a variety of frozen vegetables (without sauce), poultry, fish, and berries.</p>
 <p>For your cupboard: brown rice, quinoa, oatmeal, whole-grain cereal, whole-grain tortillas, whole-wheat pasta, whole-grain
     bread, nuts and seeds, peanut butter, onions, sweet potatoes, garlic, canned beans (low sodium), 
     canned fish (sardines, tuna, salmon), low-sodium soup, canned tomatoes, low-sodium chicken and 
     vegetable broth, tomato paste, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, mustard, herbs, and spices.</p>
